# Implementation Plan

## Overview
The overall goal is to fix the RSVP deletion functionality in the Admin page. The current implementation shows a success toast but fails to delete the item from the Supabase database, and the item reappears upon refresh. This indicates a potential issue with the Supabase delete operation or database permissions.

This plan will involve investigating the Supabase client configuration, checking database permissions (specifically Row Level Security - RLS), and ensuring the `handleDeleteRsvp` function correctly interacts with the Supabase API. The primary focus will be on `src/pages/Admin.tsx` and the Supabase database configuration.

## Types
No new types, interfaces, enums, or data structures are needed. The existing `RsvpItem` interface in `src/pages/Admin.tsx` is sufficient for the task.

## Files
File modifications will be focused on the `Admin.tsx` component and potentially Supabase migration files.
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx`: This file will be modified to enhance the error handling and logging within the `handleDeleteRsvp` function.
- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_*.sql`: A new migration file may be created if Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `rsvp_items` table need to be adjusted to allow deletion by the authenticated admin user.

## Functions
Function modifications will be limited to the `handleDeleteRsvp` function.
- `handleDeleteRsvp` (in `src/pages/Admin.tsx`):
    - The function will be updated to include more detailed logging of the `error` object returned by the Supabase `delete()` operation. This will help in diagnosing the exact cause of the deletion failure (e.g., permission denied, network error).
    - A `console.log` will be added to display the `itemId` being passed to the delete function, ensuring the correct ID is being targeted.

## Classes
No new classes will be created, and no existing classes will be modified or removed.

## Dependencies
No new packages or version changes are required. The `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency is already correctly integrated and will continue to be used.

## Testing
The testing approach will be manual and focused on verifying the deletion functionality.
- Manually test the delete functionality in the Admin page after applying the code changes.
- Verify that the RSVP item is immediately removed from the UI upon successful deletion.
- Refresh the Admin page to confirm that the deleted item does not reappear, indicating successful removal from the Supabase database.
- Monitor the browser's developer console for any errors or warnings during the delete operation.
- If a Supabase migration is applied, verify the RLS policy changes in the Supabase dashboard.

## Implementation Order
The implementation will follow these logical steps to minimize conflicts and ensure successful integration:
1.  Modify the `handleDeleteRsvp` function in `src/pages/Admin.tsx` to enhance error logging and confirm the `itemId` being used.
2.  Review the Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `rsvp_items` table to ensure that the authenticated admin user has `DELETE` permissions. This will likely involve using the Supabase dashboard or CLI.
3.  If RLS policies are found to be restrictive, create a new Supabase migration file (`supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_delete_rls.sql`) to update the RLS policy on the `rsvp_items` table, granting appropriate delete permissions.
4.  Apply the Supabase migration (if created).
5.  Test the deletion functionality thoroughly in the Admin page.
